# Lendsqr Frontend Engineer Test

This project is my submission for the frontend engineer test required for my application for the of a frontend engineer at Lendqr.

The tech stack of this project is React & Typescript and SCSS. No extra dependencies was used in the development process.

## Higlights of my implementation strategy:

- created 2 pages: Login and Dashboard.
- implemented useState hook to toggle views : Users list and Single User details.
- created icon component : easy to import and use custom icons.
- implemented a screen width notice and view restriction for better user experience: project is not fully optimized for smaller screens, due to submission deadline.

## Still in development:

- Pagination: useState to render list in range.
- Improve how data is passed: user list and single user details page.
- Optimize website for smaller screens.
